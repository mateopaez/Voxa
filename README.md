## ⚠️ Important Note
Voxa makes use of OpenAI's Whisper and GPT APIs, as well as Elevenlabs.io's text-to-speech service, all of which incur usage costs. As this app is primarily deployed for easy access during job interviews and to showcase my work, I kindly ask users to minimize usage where possible. Please only interact with the app as necessary, and I appreciate your understanding as I maintain and showcase the project. Thank you for your support!
